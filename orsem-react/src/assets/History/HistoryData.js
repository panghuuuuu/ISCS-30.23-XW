      "OrSem 2023: Muli marks the beginning of a new journey of rediscovery and exploration. We celebrate the incoming freshmen and transferees as they discover who they can become with the Ateneo community, beginning with this upcoming primarily onsite school year. Sa pagpasok ninyo sa ating tahanang Ateneo, nawa’y dalhin ninyong muli ang inyong mga pangarap, paniniwala, at adhikain. Lagi’t lagi, kasama ninyo kami sa muling pagtuklas ng bagong panahon! #OrSem2023 #OrSemMuli",

    description:
      "Tindig is a vessel for Ateneo's new set of freshies and transferees in order to not only discover their place in this new environment, but also to assert themselves and stand firm in this position - regardless of difficulties that may arise. Using Tindig to direct this year's OrSem would mean integrating the values of being principled, firm, and empowered. The past two years have been particularly rough for all of us– for many different reasons. Yet, we stand here because we continue to persevere. Regardless of the context this word may hold, we chose Tindig to signify the strength within the Ateneo Community to weather any storm and every obstacle together.",

    description:
      "In this new chapter in their lives, we ask freshies to stand together with the Ateneo community and take that step towards becoming people for others. It succeeds OrSem Tuloy as a means to continue, and now to actively take the opportunity to stand up, for ourselves and for each other, amidst the challenges and hardships present. Tayo doubles in its meaning as a pronoun, both acknowledging the separation the pandemic has brought about and challenging it by reaffirming the connections we have built and will be building in our years in Ateneo. It further highlights the need for togetherness, with each other and the whole community.",
