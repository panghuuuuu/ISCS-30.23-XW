# üè°Ô∏è Orsem Official Website

Orsem is the Ateneo De Manila University orientation seminar for incoming freshmen students. Here, students will learn about the different buildings, facilities and culture of Ateneo and its students.

## üîßÔ∏è Installation Guide

1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

2. Go to the folder where you wish to install the repository, then open your terminal to that directory.

3. Type the following commands to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/misa.eservices/orsem2020.git
   ```

## üìÇ File Structure

`orsem-django` - Main backend component of the application, made with Django

`orsem-react` - Main frontend component of the application, made with Create React App

_NOTE: Refer to the `README.md` in each folder to find their respective documentation_

## üå≥ Branch Structure

`main` - **PRODUCTION** branch of the application. Reflects what is visible to the public. Should only accept merges from `staging`.

`staging` - Mirror of the production environment for testing. For internal use only. Should only accept merges from dev branches.

`[name]-[feature]-dev` - Additional features should be split into its own branch (ex. `echo-update-frontend-dev`).

## üßë‚Äçüíª Working Guidelines

- **Rebase before merging**. For instance, merging a dev branch into `staging`, ensure first to rebase on `staging`. This is to minimize any merge conflicts.
- **Delete merged branches**. Stale branches (i.e. branches that have already been merged) are considered unnecessary and should be pruned.

## üöÄ Deployment Process

This guide outlines the steps for building Docker images, pushing them to a container registry, configuring CloudSQL, deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster, and exposing the services using Kubernetes resources.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure CloudSQL

If you're using **Google Cloud SQL** for your database, follow these steps to configure it:

### Create CloudSQL Instance

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. Navigate to **SQL** and create a new instance. Choose **PostgreSQL** or your desired database.
3. Once the instance is created, get the **instance connection name**, which will be used in your `.env` file.

### Set Up Access to CloudSQL

1. Enable the **Cloud SQL Admin API**.
2. Add the CloudSQL instance's connection name to the Kubernetes deployment configurations to allow access from the application.

### Create a Database

1. In your CloudSQL instance, create the necessary database for your application.

### Get Database Credentials

1. Note the **database username**, **password**, and the **connection name**. These will be used in your `.env` file.

### Setup `.env` file

1. Navigate to the `orsem-django` folder.

2. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Update the `.env` file with the credentials and details from your CloudSQL configuration.

4. Ensure that the following variables in the `.env` file are updated:

   - `DB_NAME`
   - `DB_USER`
   - `DB_PASSWORD`
   - `DB_HOST` (set this to the CloudSQL instance's connection name)
   - `DB_PORT`

   Example:

   ```bash
   SECRET_KEY="t8!=@d!hn$b7c0^dh1z+m&9zuomrq=w!o77#lg!=yn_g7ex=88"
   DB_NAME="django"
   DB_USER="admin"
   DB_PASSWORD="Ors3mMul1"
   DB_HOST="/cloudsql/stone-flux-442503-d1:us-central1:django"
   DB_PORT="5432"
   POSTGRES_DB="django"
   POSTGRES_USER="admin"
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD="Ors3mMul1"
   USE_S3="False"
   CLOUD_NAME="dommshw6n"
   CLOUD_API_KEY="822444996822321"
   CLOUD_API_SECRET="Na8raROPQJEr5ZxSy54zDS1esDw"
   DJANGO_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=""
   DJANGO_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=""
   RECIPIENT_LIST="orsem.ls@obf.ateneo.edu"
   EMAIL_HOST_USER="mailertester20@gmail.com"
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD="nuUnR7fEIs9L"

   # for production use prodsettings
   BASE_APP_URL=https://orsem-react-809207475199.us-central1.run.app
   BASE_BACK_END_URL=https://orsem-django-809207475199.us-central1.run.app
   ```

5. Save the `.env` file after making the necessary updates.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build Docker Images

### Backend (`orsem-django`)

1. Navigate to the `orsem-django` folder.

2. Build the Docker image for the backend:

   ```bash
   docker build -t orsem-django:latest .
   ```

   This command will build the Docker image tagged as `orsem-django:latest`.

### Frontend (`orsem-react`)

1. Navigate to the `orsem-react` folder.

2. Build the Docker image for the frontend:

   ```bash
   docker build -t orsem-react:latest .
   ```

   This will build the Docker image tagged as `orsem-react:latest`.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Push Docker Images to a Container Registry

To use the images in Kubernetes, push them to a container registry like Docker Hub.

### Tag the images

If you're using **Docker Hub**, tag the images:

```bash
docker tag orsem-django:latest <your-dockerhub-username>/orsem-django:latest
docker tag orsem-react:latest <your-dockerhub-username>/orsem-react:latest
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/orsem-django:latest
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/orsem-react:latest
```
